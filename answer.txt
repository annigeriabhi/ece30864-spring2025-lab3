a) 
Agile is flexible, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements. It also enables faster delivery with continuous feedback.
Scope creep can occur due to frequent changes. It also requires strong collaboration, which can be challenging for some teams.

Traditional development has a clear structure, making planning easier. It works well for projects with fixed requirements.
Itâ€™s less adaptable to changes, making adjustments difficult. Testing and feedback are often delayed, increasing late-stage risk
